NOTES:
hello! this is dizzle, 1/2 creators of gearedos. i hope you like the operating system, however i would like you to note that this is the first ever version of geared os
for PCs, so expect issues. later on we will be releasing an updated version which will be an upgrade to this os, not an update. this next version will be called "geared
1.1" it will fix any bugs we find and make icons and window controls look better, possibly also coming bundled with a game. do not expect quality as this is my first 
operating system. sadly i am a windows user so if i get somthing wrong i am so sorry.
